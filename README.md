# DEVELOPMENT HALTED (for now) üõë
I have stopped working on this project for now. Maybe I will continue it in the future. If you want to contribute, feel free to do so. I will be happy to see your contributions. üòä

It was a quite a challenge to make a web-based operating system, and I learned a lot from it. I will be using the knowledge I gained from this project in my future projects.

If I continue this project in the future, I think I will start from scratch and maybe even use a framework like React or at least a icon library like Font Awesome. This would make the development process much easier and faster. Tailwind CSS would also be a good choice for styling.

If you want to try it out, you can still use the demo. It is still available. üòä
